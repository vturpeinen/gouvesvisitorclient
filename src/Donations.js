            <p>Over 300 homeless and abandoned animals each year find a safe place and needed care with us - <br/>can you help us keep going?
        We do not get any help from the government, or from big organizations, <br/>but depend solely on the donations of individuals.
        Any donation, big or small, is highly appreciated and there are so many ways you can help, <br/>we are sure you will find one suited for your situation.
        We take care of more than 200 dogs and 200 cats, which is a huge task for a group of less than 10 volunteers.</p>
